Wafer is a piece of silicon or other semiconductor material,designed in the form of a very thin disc.Wafers are used to create electronic integrated circuits(ICs) and silicon-based photovoltaic cells.These wafers provide a large volume of data as an output through sensors.Based on the reading provided by the sensors and using classification machine learning algorithm.I have predicted if the wafer is faulty or not.
Objective:-Using this ML model companies can save a huge amount of man power,time as well as money.
